# HoloCompute Threat Model

## Overview

This document describes the security threats and mitigations for HoloCompute, a distributed memory and compute virtualization layer. The threat model follows the STRIDE methodology to identify and categorize potential security risks.

## Assets

### Primary Assets

1. **Cluster Data**: Shared arrays, distributed buffers, and computation results
2. **Node Resources**: CPU, memory, GPU, and storage across the cluster
3. **Network Communications**: Control plane and data plane messages
4. **Node Identities**: Ed25519 keys and node credentials
5. **Cluster State**: Membership information, shard assignments, ring topology

### Secondary Assets

1. **Configuration Data**: Cluster settings, policies, and tuning parameters
2. **Audit Logs**: Security and operational logs
3. **Performance Metrics**: Observability data and profiling information
4. **User Code**: WASM modules and plugin implementations

## Trust Boundaries

1. **Intra-Cluster**: Nodes within the same HoloCompute cluster
2. **Inter-Cluster**: Connections between different HoloCompute clusters
3. **Administrative**: Cluster operators and system administrators
4. **User Applications**: Client code using the HoloCompute API
5. **External Services**: Plugin providers and hardware accelerators

## STRIDE Threat Analysis

### Spoofing

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Node Impersonation | Attacker pretends to be a legitimate cluster node | Unauthorized access to data and resources | Ed25519 public key authentication, trust-on-first-use or pre-shared key pinning |
| Client Impersonation | Attacker pretends to be a legitimate client | Unauthorized cluster access and resource consumption | Token-based authentication with RBAC |
| Message Spoofing | Attacker injects fake control or data plane messages | Cluster state corruption, data tampering | Noise protocol with AEAD, message authentication |

### Tampering

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Data-in-Transit | Attacker modifies messages between nodes | Data corruption, computation errors | AEAD encryption (Noise over QUIC) |
| Data-at-Rest | Attacker modifies stored pages or metadata | Data corruption, privacy breach | Optional page encryption, BLAKE3 checksums |
| Configuration Tampering | Attacker modifies cluster configuration | Service disruption, security policy bypass | File integrity checks, configuration signing |
| Code Tampering | Attacker modifies WASM modules or plugins | Code execution, data exfiltration | Module hashing, secure plugin interfaces |

### Repudiation

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Action Repudiation | Node or client denies performing an action | Audit failure, non-repudiation issues | Comprehensive logging, digital signatures |
| Message Repudiation | Node denies sending a message | Protocol disputes, fault investigation | Message sequence numbers, cryptographic signatures |

### Information Disclosure

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Eavesdropping | Attacker intercepts network communications | Data exposure, credential theft | End-to-end encryption (Noise over QUIC) |
| Memory Dumping | Attacker accesses node memory | Data exposure, key extraction | Secure memory management, key encryption |
| Log Exposure | Sensitive data in logs | Privacy breach, credential leakage | Log redaction, structured logging controls |

### Denial of Service

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Resource Exhaustion | Attacker consumes CPU, memory, or network | Service unavailability, performance degradation | Resource quotas, rate limiting, backpressure |
| Message Flooding | Attacker sends excessive control messages | Control plane overload, membership instability | Rate limiting, message prioritization |
| Task Bombing | Attacker submits excessive compute tasks | Resource starvation, queue overload | Task quotas, admission control |

### Elevation of Privilege

| Threat | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Role Escalation | User gains unauthorized privileges | Unauthorized actions, data access | RBAC with least privilege principle |
| Node Promotion | Unauthorized node becomes cluster member | Cluster compromise, data access | Bootstrap security, membership voting |
| Plugin Escalation | Malicious plugin gains system access | Host compromise, data breach | WASM sandboxing, plugin isolation |

## Security Controls

### Transport Security

- **Protocol**: Noise over QUIC with XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-GCM
- **Key Exchange**: Hybrid KEM (X25519 + ML-KEM-768) with feature flag
- **Post-Quantum**: Optional lattice-based cryptography for quantum resistance
- **Certificate Pinning**: Trust-on-first-use or pre-shared key validation

### Access Control

- **Authentication**: Ed25519 public key infrastructure
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Actions**: ALLOCATE, RUN, DRAIN, SHUTDOWN with granular permissions
- **Tokens**: JWT or similar token-based authentication for clients

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-GCM for transport
- **At-Rest**: Optional AES-256 encryption for spilled pages
- **Integrity**: BLAKE3 checksums for page validation
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, storage, and rotation

### Execution Security

- **Sandboxing**: WASM runtime with restricted syscalls
- **Timeouts**: Deterministic execution limits
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and I/O constraints
- **Plugin Isolation**: gRPC interfaces with privilege separation

### Observability

- **Logging**: Structured, redacted logs with security events
- **Metrics**: Security-related metrics (failed auth, rate limits)
- **Auditing**: Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations
- **Monitoring**: Anomaly detection for suspicious behavior

## Deployment Considerations

### Network Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict cluster ports to trusted networks
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate cluster traffic from other services
- **Ingress Control**: Validate and filter incoming connections
- **Egress Control**: Limit outbound connections from cluster nodes

### Physical Security

- **Node Security**: Secure physical access to cluster nodes
- **Key Storage**: Hardware security modules for key protection
- **Boot Integrity**: Secure boot and trusted platform modules
- **Firmware Updates**: Verified firmware updates with rollback protection

### Operational Security

- **Personnel Training**: Security awareness for operators
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for security incidents
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted, integrity-protected backups

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy controls
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data handling requirements
- **SOX**: Financial data integrity and audit controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data protection

### Industry Standards

- **NIST**: Cryptographic standards and key management
- **FIPS**: Federal information processing requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

## Mitigation Summary

HoloCompute implements defense-in-depth security through:

1. **Strong Encryption**: Noise over QUIC with post-quantum options
2. **Authentication**: Ed25519 public key infrastructure
3. **Authorization**: RBAC with token-based access control
4. **Sandboxing**: WASM runtime with restricted capabilities
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
6. **Resilience**: Rate limiting, backpressure, and fault tolerance
7. **Verification**: Checksums, digital signatures, and integrity checks

These controls work together to provide a secure distributed computing environment while maintaining the performance and flexibility needed for heterogeneous computing clusters.
